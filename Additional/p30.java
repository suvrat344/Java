// The program should accept account opening requests in the following format:
// Number of savings accounts to be opened
// The account number  acc_no and balance of each savings account 
// Number of current accounts to be opened
// The account number, balance and over draft limit of each current account
// All the requests are forwarded to the accountProcessor method which, in turn, validates the requests, and prints the details according to the following criteria.
// Each valid account should have a unique account number. In case there are multiple account requests with the same account number, only the first request should be processed, and the rest should be discarded.
// Hint: Use the  LinkedHashSet collection, and override the equals and hashCode methods to achieve this feature. The methods equals and hashCode are defined inside the Object class.	
// Once all the duplicate account requests are filtered out and unique valid accounts are opened, the program should print the details of all the valid accounts in descending order of balance, in the format shown in the public test cases. 
// Hint: Use the  TreeSet collection, and override the compareTo method to achieve this feature. The method compareTo is declared inside the Comparable interface.
