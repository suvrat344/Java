// Write a program to clone an object e1 of class  Employee by implementing the interface Cloneable. After cloning, update the department and the address of  e1. Complete the program as detailed below to achieve this functionality.   
// Define classes Address and Department that implement the interface Cloneable, and have the following members: 
// In both classes, add an instance variable of String type (to store the address and the department respectively) 
// Implement the required constructor(s) and accessors. 
// Override the method clone.
// Define a class Person that implements the interface Cloneable, and has the following members:
// Instance variables name of type String and addr of type Address	
// Implement the required constructor(s) and accessors
// Override the method clone
// Define a class Employee that implements the interface Cloneable, extends the class Person, and has the following members:
// Instance variable dept of type Department	
// Implement the required constructor(s) and accessors.
// Override the method clone.
// Define a method updateEmp to update the dept and addr of an Employee object
